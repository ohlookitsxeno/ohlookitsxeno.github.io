<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<hr>
<p><b>Hi!</b> I'm Xavier T. (I hope whoever is reading this appreciates me trying to recreate the old StudentLink look.)</p>

<p>I'm a Junior at Boston University, pursuing a BA/MS in Computer Science.</p>

<p>I grew up in San Antonio Texas, which is a city with some of the best mexican food in the country. My absolute favorites there are the <a href="assets/enchiladas.jpg">Blanco's Cafe enchiladas</a>, and <a href="assets/tacos.jpg">Suadero y Al Pastor from Taquitos West Ave</a>.</p>

<p>I have a few hobbies and passions, like:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>High-End Audio</b> <br>I am a massive fan of High-end headphones, speakers, IEMs (earbuds) and the gear that revolves around it. My main headphones are the Focal Elex, and Hifiman HE-1000 stealth.</li>
	<li><b>Vinyl</b> <br> I love record players and maintain a huge vinyl record collection, which you can see <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/ohlookitsxeno/collection">here</a>. The turntable I use is a Project Debut Carbon.</li>
	<li><b>Music</b> <br> If it isn't obvious by the previous two points, I am very much a music person. You can see a chart of my favorite music <a href="assets/topster7small.jpg">here</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Formula 1</b> <br> Formula 1 is easily my favorite sport to watch. My favorite driver/team is Charles Leclerc and Ferrari, but McLaren is a very close second.</li>
	<li><b>Keyboards</b> <br> I am a huge fan of custom-made mechanical keyboards. You can see my main keyboard I built <a href="assets/keyboard.jpg">here</a>. It uses the Iris PCB, with Gateron Quinn switches, and a 3D printed case.</li>
	<li><b>Cats</b> <br> I have a large enough obsession with cats that I feel its worth adding to this list.</li>
	<li><b>Classical Piano</b> <br> I used to practice piano full-time while studing at a music center bak in San Antonio. My favorite composer is Ravel, his pieces <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkAnau-XU80">genuinely sound magical</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Food</b> <br> Growing up in a city who's entire identity is centered around their extremely rich food culture, It would be impossible for me not to absolutely love a good meal.</li>
</ul>
